## General Development Guidelines and Project Structure
The following rules and principles guide the development of this project
to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

### Backend Integration
The backend code for Recitapp is located at https://github.com/113935-Quilpatay-Nahuel-Ignacio/recitapp-api, specifically in the directory https://github.com/113935-Quilpatay-Nahuel-Ignacio/recitapp-api/tree/master/src/main.

### General Rules
*   Do not apologize.
*   Do not thank the user.
*   Communicate naturally, like a human.
*   Always verify information before making changes.
*   Preserve all existing code structures unless there's a clear, justified reason to modify them.
*   Respond concisely and with relevance.
*   Validate all logic and assumptions before committing changes.
*   If the keyword "EN" is used, write in English.
*   If the keyword "ES" is used, write in Spanish.
*   Clearly explain why any code was written, including the reasoning (e.g. best practices, project requirements, stakeholder input).
*   Test all methods thoroughly to ensure coverage — this is critical.
*   Always write code comments in English.

### Violations That Will Be Penalized
*   Skipping reasoning steps
*   Leaving placeholders or TODO comments for others
*   Delivering code that isn't fully production-ready

### You Must
*   Follow the user's intent exactly
*   Never break existing functionality unless you can restore it completely and with confidence
*   Minimize your diff — smallest possible changes win

### File-by-File Changes
*   Make changes in small, incremental steps
*   Test all changes rigorously before committing
*   Document changes clearly and meaningfully in commit messages

### Code Style and Formatting (Angular 17 Specific)
*   Follow the project's coding standards precisely (see .eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, .editorconfig).
*   Use consistent and descriptive naming conventions.
*   Do not use deprecated libraries, functions, or APIs. Stay updated with Angular 17 best practices.
*   Lines should not be more than 80 characters.
*   Functions and methods should not have more than 4 parameters.
*   Functions should not have more than 50 executable lines.
*   Do not nest code more than 2 levels deep.
*   Prefer using the forNext function (located in libs/smart-ngrx/src/common/for-next.function.ts) instead of for(let i;i < length;i++), forEach or for(x of y).
*   When refactoring existing code, keep jsdoc comments intact.

### Debugging and Testing
*   Include detailed debug information in log files.
*   Write full unit test coverage for all new logic.
*   Ensure all tests pass before merge.

### Project Structure Adherence
*   Maintain a clean, organized, and logical project layout (as per the structure overview above).
*   Use meaningful, readable names for all files and directories.
*   Remove unused or obsolete files promptly to avoid clutter.

### Clean Code Principles
#### DRY – Don't Repeat Yourself
Avoid duplication. Any logic should exist in only one place. If something changes, it should only need to change in one place. Use functions, services, or classes to reuse code.
#### Curly's Law – Do One Thing
Every component (class, function, variable) must represent one concept and do one thing only. A function that behaves differently in different contexts is a red flag.
#### KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid
Simplicity is your default strategy. Favor simple, obvious, readable code over cleverness or unnecessary complexity. Simpler code is faster to write, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs.
#### Don't Make Me Think
Your code should be instantly readable and understandable without mental gymnastics. If a reader has to stop and think to understand it, it likely needs simplification.
#### YAGNI – You Aren't Gonna Need It
Never implement functionality just because you "might need it later." Only build what's required now. Overengineering is a cost, not a feature.

**Benefits:**
*   Saves time by avoiding unnecessary work
*   Keeps code clean and lean by avoiding unused complexity
#### Premature Optimization Is the Root of All Evil
Optimize only when necessary, and only after profiling confirms it's a performance bottleneck. Don't sacrifice readability or maintainability for micro-efficiencies.
> "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."
> — Donald Knuth
#### Boy Scout Rule
Always leave the code better than you found it. When you touch a file, clean up anything unclear, messy, or outdated. Refactor opportunistically and responsibly.
#### Code for the Maintainer
Write code as if the next person to maintain it is an unpredictable, easily enraged expert who knows your home address. Clarity, simplicity, and maintainability matter.
#### Principle of Least Astonishment
Code should behave exactly as its name, structure, and documentation suggest. Avoid surprises. Favor convention over configuration, and eliminate unexpected side effects.
